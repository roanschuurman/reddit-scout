# Sprint 02 Summary: Campaign CRUD

**Completed:** 2026-01-14

## Goal

Implement core campaign management functionality - create, read, update, and delete campaigns.

## Delivered

### Backend Routes
- Full CRUD operations for campaigns at `/campaigns`
- Multi-tenant isolation (users only see their own campaigns)
- Form validation with error display
- Flash messages via query params

### Templates
- Campaign list page with card layout and empty state
- New campaign form
- Campaign detail page (shows subreddits, keywords, settings placeholders)
- Edit campaign form
- Delete confirmation modal

### Testing
- 20 tests passing (19 campaign tests + 1 health check)
- Ruff linting: All checks passed
- Mypy: Success, no issues found

## Key Files Changed

- `src/reddit_scout/api/routes/campaigns.py` - New CRUD endpoints
- `src/reddit_scout/templates/campaigns/` - List, detail, new, edit templates
- `src/reddit_scout/api/routes/__init__.py` - Router registration
- `src/reddit_scout/api/main.py` - Router mounting
- `tests/conftest.py` - Test fixtures
- `tests/test_campaigns.py` - Comprehensive CRUD tests

## Technical Decisions

- Used POST for update/delete instead of PUT/DELETE (HTML forms limitation)
- Used `selectinload` for eager loading of relationships
- Form fields default to empty strings for custom validation

## What's Next

Campaign configuration features:
- Configure subreddits per campaign
- Configure keywords per campaign
- Set scan frequency
- Assign Discord channel
