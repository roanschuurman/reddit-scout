## Completed Tasks

### Package Rename

- [x] Updated pyproject.toml, docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile

### New Data Models
- [x] `DiscordUser` - Discord user with channel_id, optional API key
- [x] `UserKeyword` - Keywords per user
- [x] `ContentSource` - Sources like "hackernews"
- [x] `SourceThread` - User's thread per source
- [x] `HNItem` - Hacker News stories/comments
- [x] `UserAlert` - Alerts with status (pending/sent/dismissed)

### Infrastructure
- [x] Fresh Alembic migration (`001_initial_schema.py`)
- [x] Encryption utility (`crypto.py`) for API key storage
- [x] Updated config.py with new env vars (ENCRYPTION_KEY, DISCORD_GUILD_ID, HN settings)

### Cleanup
- [x] Removed PRAW/SuperTokens dependencies
- [x] Removed old models (User, Campaign, Match, etc.)

### Tests
- [x] 7 tests passing (1 health + 6 model tests)

## Key Decisions

1. **Discord-first**: All user interaction via slash commands, no web UI
2. **Per-user API keys**: Users can provide their own OpenRouter key for AI summaries
3. **Encrypted storage**: User API keys stored with Fernet encryption
4. **Source threads**: Alerts organized by content source (HN thread, future Reddit thread, etc.)
