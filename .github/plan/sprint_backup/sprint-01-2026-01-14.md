# Sprint 01 Summary: Project Foundation

**Completed:** 2026-01-14

## Goal
Set up the foundational project structure with working database, migrations, and basic auth.

## Delivered
- Python project structure with FastAPI
- Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL + web app
- SQLAlchemy models (User, Campaign, CampaignSubreddit, CampaignKeyword, Match, DraftResponse)
- Alembic migrations (initial migration with all models)
- Session-based authentication with bcrypt + signed cookies
- Login/register pages with HTMX + DaisyUI
- Protected routes with login redirect
- Health check endpoint

## Key Decisions
- **Auth approach**: Used simple session-based auth with bcrypt instead of SuperTokens for MVP simplicity
- **bcrypt directly**: Used bcrypt package instead of passlib due to Python 3.14 compatibility issues
- **greenlet**: Added for async Alembic migrations support

## Commits
- `60581de` feat(auth): add Alembic migrations and session-based authentication
- `6f80fa1` feat: project structure, backlog, and sprint 01
- `b74a390` docs: initial project setup with design doc and workflow
