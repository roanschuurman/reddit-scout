# Sprint 07: Discord Enhancements - SUPERSEDED

**Status:** Superseded by pivot to Community Scout (Sprint 08)

**Original Goal:** Complete the Discord workflow with regenerate, refine, and copy functionality for AI drafts.

---

## Outcome

Sprint 07 was planned but not executed. The project pivoted from Reddit Scout to Community Scout in Sprint 08, which changed the data model from `Match` to `UserAlert`.

**Ideas carried forward to Sprint 11:**
- Regenerate button for AI summaries
- Refine button with thread-based conversation
- Copy button for easy copying
- Persistent views across bot restarts

These features will be implemented for the new `UserAlert` model in the notification pipeline.

## Original Tasks (Not Completed)

- Regenerate button on notifications
- Refine button with Discord thread conversation
- Copy button with ephemeral message
- Persistent views

See Sprint 11 for the new implementation plan.
